      8. Supply and Demand (Why There\'s a Limited Amount of Bitcoin)
      """
    let h2 = """
      The limited supply of Bitcoin is a fundamental aspect of its design and contributes to its value proposition. Here\'s an explanation of why there\'s a limited amount of Bitcoin and how supply and demand dynamics affect its price:
      """

    let h3 = """
      1.Fixed Supply:
      """
    let h4 = """
      The total supply of bitcoins is capped at 21 million coins by the Bitcoin protocol. This limit is hardcoded into the software and cannot be changed without broad consensus among network participants. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed or minted at will by central banks, the issuance of new bitcoins follows a predetermined schedule that halves approximately every four years in a process known as the "halving."
      """

    let h5 = """
      2.Halving Mechanism:
      """
    let h6 = """
      Every 210,000 blocks mined, the block reward for miners is halved. Initially set at 50 bitcoins per block when Bitcoin was launched in 2009, the block reward decreases by half approximately every four years. As a result, the rate of new bitcoin issuance decreases over time, leading to a gradual reduction in the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation. This halving mechanism is designed to mimic the scarcity and diminishing returns of finite resources like gold.
      """

    let h7 = """
      3.Scarcity and Value:
      """
    let h8 = """
      The fixed supply of bitcoins creates scarcity, which, combined with increasing demand, can lead to upward pressure on its price. Like any asset, the price of Bitcoin is influenced by supply and demand dynamics. As demand for bitcoins increases, whether due to increased adoption, institutional investment, or geopolitical uncertainty, and as the rate of new supply issuance decreases due to halving events, the price of Bitcoin may rise to reflect its perceived value.
      """

    let h9 = """
      4.Store of Value:
      """
    let h10 = """
      Bitcoin proponents often liken it to digital gold due to its scarcity and perceived store of value properties. Like gold, which has a limited supply and has been used as a store of value for centuries, Bitcoin\'s fixed supply makes it resistant to inflationary pressures and may make it attractive to investors seeking to hedge against currency devaluation or economic uncertainty.
      """

    let h11 = """
      5.Market Dynamics:
      """
    let h12 = """
      Bitcoin\'s price is determined by supply and demand dynamics in the open market, where buyers and sellers exchange bitcoins based on their perceived value. Factors such as investor sentiment, macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and geopolitical events can influence supply and demand dynamics and impact Bitcoin\'s price.
      """

    let h13 = """
      Overall, the limited supply of Bitcoin is a key feature that distinguishes it from traditional fiat currencies and contributes to its value proposition as a decentralized digital asset with the potential to serve as a hedge against inflation and store of value in the digital age.
