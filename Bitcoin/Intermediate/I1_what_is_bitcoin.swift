     WAHT IS BITCOIN?
     """

    let a2 = """
     Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, often referred to as cryptocurrency. It was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto and was released as open-source software in 2009. Bitcoin operates on a peer-to-peer network, meaning transactions occur directly between users without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments.
     """

    let a3 = """
     Key features of Bitcoin include:
     """

    let a4 = """
     1.Decentralization:
     """
    let a5 = """
     Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network of computers (nodes) around the world, making it immune to control or manipulation by any single entity.
     """

    let a6 = """
     2.Blockchain Technology:
     """
    let a7 = """
     Transactions on the Bitcoin network are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. This blockchain is maintained by a network of nodes through a process called mining.
     """

    let a8 = """
     3.Limited Supply:
     """
    let a9 = """
     Bitcoin\'s supply is capped at 21 million coins, making it a deflationary asset. This scarcity is built into the protocol, with new bitcoins being created as a reward for miners who contribute computational power to secure the network.
     """

    let a10 = """
     4.Security:
     """
    let a11 = """
     Bitcoin transactions are secured through cryptographic techniques. Each transaction is verified by miners and recorded on the blockchain, making it difficult to alter or counterfeit.
     """

    let a12 = """
     5.Pseudonymity:
     """
    let a13 = """
     While transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are public, the identities of the users involved are pseudonymous. Users are identified by alphanumeric addresses rather than personal information.
     """

    let a14 = """
     6.Global Accessibility:
     """
    let a15 = """
     Bitcoin can be sent or received anywhere in the world, 24/7, as long as the sender and receiver have internet access.
     """

    let a16 = """
     7.Permissionless:
     """
    let a17 = """
     Anyone can participate in the Bitcoin network without needing approval. Users can send and receive bitcoins without restrictions.
     """

    let a18 = """
     Bitcoin has gained widespread adoption as both a digital currency and a store of value. It is used for various purposes, including online purchases, remittances, investment, and as a hedge against inflation. However, its price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and scalability issues are some of the challenges it faces as it continues to evolve.
